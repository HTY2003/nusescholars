# NUS DE Scholars website repo

Welcome to the NUS DE Scholars website repo! You may find our (WIP) site [here](https://nusescholars.vercel.app/)

## Getting started 

To get started with the project, change directory to where you wish to store the project on your 
system using the `cd` command. You may open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac),
and type `cd` and drag-and-drop the directory that you wish to 
add this project folder to, to your terminal.

# Clone the repository

Once in the right directory, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/escholars-web/nusescholars
```

This will create a new folder called `nusescholars` in your directory. Open this directory with your favourite 
IDE or text / code editor.

# Set up the requirements 

This project involves NodeJS. You may install that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)

Recommended installation mode: prebuilt installer

# Add the packages to your system

Using any terminal, ensure that you are in the project directory. You may use `cd` to change to the right directory.
Open the file and run the following commands **one by one**:

Mac / Linux:
```
chmod a+x ./requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
```

Windows:
```
git bash ./requirements.sh
```

This will set up the necessary packages that you need.
